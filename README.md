# Quora-question-pair-similarity-detection-model
Motivation: Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked.

Real world/Business Objectives and Constraints :
The cost of a mis-classification can be very high.
You would want a probability of a pair of questions to be duplicates so that you can choose any threshold of choice.
No strict latency concerns.
Interpretability is partially important.
